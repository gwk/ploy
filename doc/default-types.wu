`<x=0:Int y=1:Int>` is a value whose type is `<Dflt<Int> Dflt<Int>>'.
this is essentially the union type `Any<<> <Int> <Int Int>>`;
Dflt exists to prevent combinatorial explosion and provide clarity of intent.

The parameter of a function signature is an 'Any' type; it accepts any of the member types.
