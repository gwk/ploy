# Ploy/JavaScript Runtime

Ploy is designed to work with multiple backends, specifically JavaScript for the web and future native backends. I am taking care to avoid letting JavaScript details leak into the language design.


# Objects

Currently, Ploy objects compile to JS objects as follows:
* Int: number
* Flt: number
* Str: string
* Null: null
* Functions: JS functions
* Structs and Unions: JS classes
* Interfaces: ?
Structs and Unions are declared as JS types with opaque names of the form `C<N>`, where `<N>` is the type's global index.


# Polyfunctions

Polyfunctions compile into a JS function for each morph.

# Generic Functions

Generic functions compile into a single JS function.
