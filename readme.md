  <p>
    Ploy is an experimental, general purpose programming language. It is a statically typed language, and aspires to be a pragmatic choice for both small and large-scale projects. The language design is inspired by aspects of Lisp and Scheme, as well as a variety of statically typed languages. Ploy is in an early stage of development, and is not yet practically useful.
